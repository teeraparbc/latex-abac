	There are some special characters which you need to be careful when typed such as \#, \$, \%, \&. Those characters have special meaning in \LaTeX so the escape character ``\textbackslash" is needed.
	
	Symbols can also be produced in \LaTeX\ with special commands such as \pounds, \S, \P, \dag or \ddag. Some symbols need the package amssymb such as \checkmark, \maltese, \yen
