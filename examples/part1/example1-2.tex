	You can write a normal sentence; however, it does not matter whether you enter one or several        spaces after a word.
However, if you start a new line without an empty line between. LaTeX will treat the lines as being continuous.

An empty line starts a new paragraph.



Again, it does not mattter how many empty lines you enter.
